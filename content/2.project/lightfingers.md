Lightfingers is a turn-based multiplayer game where you play as a thief competing with other thieves to steal the most treasure from a procedurally generated board. It was developed by Numizmatic Games and published by [Indie Fund](https://indie-fund.com/).

I was the producer on Lightfingers, and I worked with the team to help them develop the game from a prototype to a full release. I also helped with the business side of things, including marketing, PR, and business development.
